# MACHINE LEARNING Project

## Description
This repository contains the Python code and scripts for Machine Learning experiments.  

## Important Guidelines
To keep the repository clean and lightweight:

1. **Do NOT commit large dataset files** (e.g., `.csv`, `.xlsx`) directly.
2. Use cloud storage (Google Drive, AWS S3) for datasets.
3. Ignore temporary or log files.
4. Only commit code, notebooks, scripts, and configuration files.

## Recommended Workflow
- Add new code or notebooks.
- Keep datasets outside the repo.
- Use Git LFS for large models or datasets if needed.
